The provided code implements arithmetic operations on large numbers using linked lists. Here's a breakdown:

1.Node Structure:It defines a `Node` struct to represent each digit of a large number. Each node has an `int digit` to store the value and a `Node* next` pointer to link to the next digit.

2. Functions for Node Manipulation:
   - `createNode`: Allocates memory for a new node and initializes its digit and next pointer.
   - `appendDigit`: Adds a new digit to the end of the linked list representing the number.
   - `reverseList`: Reverses the order of nodes in the linked list. This is necessary for efficient addition and subtraction.

3.Functions for Reading and Writing Numbers:
   - `readNumber`: Reads a number from a file character by character, converting characters to digits and building the linked list representation.
   - `printNumber`: Prints the digits of the number stored in the linked list.
   - `writeNumberToFile`: Writes the number stored in the linked list to a file.

4.Arithmetic Functions:
   - `addNumbers`: Adds two large numbers represented by linked lists. It reverses the lists, performs digit-wise addition with carry handling, and builds the resulting sum as a new linked list.
   - `multiplyNumbers`: Multiplies two large numbers represented by linked lists. It uses a nested loop approach, multiplying each digit of one number with all digits of the other, handling carry and building the resulting product as a new linked list.
   - `subtractNumbers`: Subtracts two large numbers represented by linked lists. It reverses the lists, performs digit-wise subtraction with borrow handling, and builds the resulting difference as a new linked list.
   - `divideNumbers`: Divides two large numbers represented by linked lists. It implements a long division algorithm, iteratively subtracting the divisor from the dividend until it becomes smaller and keeping track of the quotient digits.

5.Main Function:
   - Opens two files: "numbers.txt" for reading the two numbers and "results.txt" for writing the results.
   - Reads the two numbers from the file using `readNumber`.
   - Performs addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division using the respective functions.
   - Writes the original numbers and the calculated results (sum, product, quotient) to the "results.txt" file.
   - Closes both files.

This code provides a way to perform arithmetic operations on very large numbers that wouldn't fit into standard integer data types.
